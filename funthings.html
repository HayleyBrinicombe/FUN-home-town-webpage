    <p>Someone once said that you have to know Manchester to love it, and this may be true.

    But once you do get to know it, to understand it, you will realise why Mancunians are so rightly proud of their concrete piece of heaven.

    My name is Hayley Brinicombe, I am Manchester born and bred, and throughout this page I hope to give you a pretty good idea why I am so proud of my home town Manchester. 

    It would also be wondeful if I could convinve you to come and vist.</p>
