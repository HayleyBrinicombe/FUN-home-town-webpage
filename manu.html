    <h1>My football team</h1>
    <img src="/images/manchesterunited.jpg" alt="Man United image">

    <p>Since 1992, we have won the Premier League 13 times. In total, we have won a record 20 English League titles, a record 12 FA Cups, 4 League Cups, 3 European Champions Cups and 1 FIFA Club World Cup, making us one of the most successful clubs in England.</p>
    <p>From being a little girl my Grandad would always buy me and my sibling the latest shirt, I loved attending games and learning all about the history of the club. Still to this day my passion for the team runs deep.</p>
