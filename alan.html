      Alan Turing Alan Mathison Turing (1912–1954) was a mathematician, computer
      scientist and codebreaker. Often dubbed ‘the father of modern computing’,
      Turing was based at The University of Manchester after his work with the
      British Intelligence Service at Bletchley Park during World War II. His
      contribution lead to the breaking of the German Enigma machine, an
      achievement that sees him chosen as the next face on the £50 note. Despite
      his remarkable achievements, as a gay man Turing was prosecuted for gross
      indecency in 1952, at a time when homosexuality was illegal in the UK. An
      inquest concluded his death from cyanide poisoning two years later was
      suicide. After a long-fought campaign, he was posthumously pardoned by HM
      The Queen in 2013.

      I admire Alan on multiple levels, through his love for tecnology and that
      I identify as a Gay woman.
