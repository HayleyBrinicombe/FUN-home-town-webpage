    <p>Aside from offering an alternative shopping fix, The Northern Quarter is home to many independent restaurants and bars, providing a unique experience after dark. Try Odd Bar for continental beers, The Bay Horse for a pool table, Trof for a relaxed yet quirky atmosphere and Mint Lounge for dancing the night away.</p>

    <p>I grew up in South Manchester, but my roots are Ancoats and the generations have turned full circle again, as I am fortunate enough to live in an apartment right in the heart of the Northern Quater in the city centre. We often go down memory lane when my parents as my Mum always has stories of walking the streets as a child and the buildings are still the same but these days with so more more happening in them. Its a quirky sometomes noisey, but lovely place to live with wonderful places to eat, drink and shop.</p>
